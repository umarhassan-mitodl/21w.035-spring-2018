Class #1: Class Overview and Introductions, Writing for a General Audience
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

### _Assignment #1: Write an Introduction Letter_

Write a letter to me introducing yourself to me as a writer: What’s your relationship to writing? What are your hopes (and fears?) for this class? What happened with you and writing in high school, or elsewhere? Anything else about you & writing you want to tell me?—e.g., is English your second language, writing you’ve done on your own, what you like to read... 1 page, word processed, single-spaced with space between paragraphs (i.e., letter format).

### Readings:

*   William Zinsser’s “Science, Technology and Nature,” a chapter from his popular book _On Writing Well_ (now in its 7th printing). Zinsser has been a journalist, nonfiction writer, and writing teacher. He writes about writing well from the point of view of a journalist, not an academician.
*   The first three entries in the Steven Strogatz “On Math” series (you may, of course, read more!). A former MIT professor, Strogatz now teaches at Cornell. Strogatz demonstrates how even abstract topics can be written about in a lively way.
*   Dennis Overbye’s “Gravitational Waves Detected, Confirming Einstein’s Theory,” a news story from the _New York Times_ written a few days after the event. This article is given as a web link because it contains a cool embedded video, plus a sound link.

For class discussion: We’ll take time to look at the main ideas and the writing in each reading, as well as the examples Zinsser uses. Notice how Strogatz engages you, and how you respond. How does Overbye present complex theory? That is, read actively. Read these and all homework assignments actively—that is: Notice who wrote it, and her or his background. Think about what the title means. Mark passages you like, that puzzle you, and that you think contain the essay’s core ideas. Notice how the essay or article is put together. Ask questions in the margin, summarize points, and talk back to the writer. Leave time to read each assignment thoroughly—and ideally, more than once.

Class #2: The Pleasures and Challenges of Science Writing; The Importance of Metaphors in Science Writing; Describing and Explaining: Clarity, Liveliness
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #2: Idea for The Science of Everyday Life

Write a one short paragraph proposal for {{% resource_link c3a0f599-f3a7-4c54-0525-ad26d0ca865c "_The Science of Everyday Life_" %}}—what would you like to write about? Why? We'll discuss in class.

### Readings:

*   Rinku Patel’s “Bugged,” which appeared in _Popular Science_ in the summer of 2015.
*   From the _NY Times_, “How Layers in a Latte Form.”

Read actively! Make comments and ask questions in the margins; take notes. Notice how these writers explain their various subjects; mark passages that you think are especially effective.

For class discussion: While these essays are different in subject matter and approach, all exemplify the range of possibilities of essays on topics in science or technology. We’ll look especially at descriptions and structure: how does each writer tell the story? How do they create a clear focus? And we’ll think about audience: How do they engage readers?

Class #3: Focus, Accuracy, and Making it Fresh; A Writer's Voice
----------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #3: {{% resource_link c3a0f599-f3a7-4c54-0525-ad26d0ca865c "The Science of Everyday Life" %}}

Class #4: Workshop on Essay 1
-----------------------------

### Assignment #4: Workshop Essays, Book Talk

{{% resource_link 0db94956-df48-17cd-16d9-d6fe5d0e6e78 "Re-read and critique" %}} your workshop partners' _The Science of Everyday Life_ essays. Select a book for your {{% resource_link 813ff894-c3fa-466e-d01a-8a8dedd51914 "book talk" %}}. Feel free to ask me questions about the books.

### Readings:

*   Kevin Patterson’s “The Patient Predator.” Patterson is a physician and writer with a quiet but powerful voice.
*   Atul Gawande’s “The Pain Perplex.” Gawande is a surgeon at Brigham & Women’s hospital and a best-selling writer on medical topics.
*   The 1st chapter of Elise Hancock’s _Ideas into Words_, and skim the 2nd chapter.We’ll discuss these chapters in class.

For class discussion: Besides being interesting, both of these essays on medical topics are very well put together. Be prepared to talk about strategies Patterson and Gawande used to organize their materials. For example, note metaphors they use both to describe something and help shape their essays. Also be prepared to note examples of what you consider to be good writing, and say what makes them good.

Class #5: Attitudes Towards Writing; What Do We Mean by Revision? 
------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #5: Revise {{% resource_link c3a0f599-f3a7-4c54-0525-ad26d0ca865c "The Science of Everyday Life" %}}

### Readings:

*   Tafton, Anne. “[New way to stop the bleeding: Nanoscale biological coating developed at MIT could prevent battlefield deaths](http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/stop-bleeding-0110.html).” MIT News Office. January 10, 2012.
*   Hardesty, Larry. “[Imaging with an ‘optical brush’](http://news.mit.edu/2016/imaging-optical-fibers-brush-0212).” MIT News Office. February 12, 2016.
*   Chu, Jennifer. “[Microfluidics from LEGO bricks](http://news.mit.edu/2018/microfluidics-lego-bricks-0131).” MIT News Office. January 30, 2018.
*   Hancock, Chapter 5, "The Nitty-Gritty" and "Refining Your Draft."

As you read these stories, note what they have in common: what kinds of things do the writers do? Where does certain information, such as where a study is published, go? What do the introductions—or “leads,” as journalists call them—do? What is the take-away message—the biggest point—for each of these stories? Do the stories make it clear why this point matters? How is technical complexity handled? Do you notice images or analogies that the writers use to make the concepts more easily understood? We’ll spend most of class discussing news writing and these readings.  

Class #6: Elements of News Writing; Reading a Scientific Journal, Pt. 1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #6: Proposal for Profile article

Write a proposal for the {{% resource_link 604d023b-fd0c-30ae-5353-3ae40038d3af "profile article" %}}. Select 2 possible profile subjects and explain their areas of expertise and why you want to write about them. 

### Readings:

*   The three student-written profiles in the [2013 _Angles_ online magazine](http://cmsw.mit.edu/angles/2013/) of exemplary writing.
*   “[Spacesuits and Drones](http://cmsw.mit.edu/angles/2016/wp/spacesuits-and-drones/)” by Andrew DeNucci from the 2016 _Angles_. 
*   “[Light up and Clean up](http://cmsw.mit.edu/angles/2017/light-up-and-clean-up/)” by Karina Hinojosa from the 2017 _Angles_.
*   Hancock, Chapter 3, "Research and the Interview."

You should make notes about what you read—what do you notice about the way the writers put their articles together? Begin making a list of elements that make up a good profile-type article.

For class discussion: What do these articles have in common? Be prepared to point to specific passages that capture the spirit or personality of the person being profiled, as well as passages that do a good job of explaining the science. 

Class #7: The Profile: Writing about Science by Writing
-------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #7: Sketch News Story

Write a preliminary sketch of a {{% resource_link 907097c0-8302-0ee5-6352-dcf3a2129046 "news story" %}} for one of these articles. 

### Readings:

*   “Map the Gap” from the journal _Public Health Action_. “Map the Gap” is a standard journal article; journal articles follow roughly the same format from journal to journal and field to field.
*   “The Trouble with Negative Emissions” from _Science_ appears under a heading “Perspectives.” This is an article by scientists, with plentiful citations, but it does not describe original research; rather, it presents an analysis of a climate change issue.

Either one of these articles could furnish material for a news story in a general interest publication.

Class #8: From Research to News

-------------------------------

### Assignment #9: Discuss Profile Article Proposals (In Class)

Come to class prepared to discuss your proposal for the {{% resource_link 604d023b-fd0c-30ae-5353-3ae40038d3af "profile article" %}}.

### Readings:

*   Robert Stickgold’s _Scientific American_ essay, “Sleep On It!” which summarizes recent findings in neuroscience about why we need to sleep. Stickgold is on the faculty at the Harvard Medical School’s Sleep and Cognition lab.
*   Tom Levenson’s _Boston Globe_ “Ideas” section essay about the growing problems arising from overuse of antibiotics. While Levenson’s essay also summarizes findings, it is clearly intended to be persuasive. Levenson is on the faculty of MIT’s Graduate Program in Science Writing; he has written several books and created documentaries on science topics.

For class discussion: Let’s discuss these reading in two ways. First, what are your reactions as a reader—what is news to you, what is convincing or intriguing, and why? Second, let’s think about them as good models for the investigative essay. How would you describe the way Stickgold and Levenson put their essays together? How are they shaped? What kind of evidence do they use? How do they use it? How do they keep “the human element” in sight?

Class #10: Stickgold & Levenson: Elements of a Research-Based Essay; The Research Process: Note Taking
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #10: Progress Report for Profile Subjects (In Class)

Come to class prepared to give a progress report on your {{% resource_link 604d023b-fd0c-30ae-5353-3ae40038d3af "profile article" %}} subjects.

### Readings:

*   Malcolm Gladwell’s “The Engineer’s Lament.” Gladwell is a _New Yorker_ writer who has written several best-selling books in recent years, including _The Tipping Point_ and _Outliers_. He has a distinctive voice and way of structuring his articles. In this essay, he aims to help us see how engineers approach the issue of auto safety.

For class discussion: We’ll save some class time to discuss your reactions to the essay. But we’ll start by considering it structurally, looking at the “pieces” that Gladwell assembles to make a coherent and powerful essay, and how he brings them together. Besides looking at structure, consider the sources Gladwell consulted in writing this essay: whether or not sources are cited (they often are not cited in essays and articles published in magazines), try to imagine what kind of sources these must have been—that is, imagine you were Gladwell: what sources would you need to consult to write this essay?

Class #11: Gladwell: Describing How Engineers Think; Incorporating Many Kinds of Evidence
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #11: Write a Summary of Schultz's "The Really Big One"

Write a 200–250-word summary of Schulz’s article. A good summary should:

*   Accurately represent the key ideas and concerns of the original text.
*   Highlight/emphasize/prioritize the main ideas and writer’s moves of the piece.
    *   Note: this means you probably won’t follow the same sequence as the article.
*   Include key terms.
*   Avoid your own judgment—i.e., in a summary you are aiming to transparently represent another writer’s thinking.
*   Be coherent—it should read logically, sentence to sentence. (That is, it should make sense on its own.)

### Readings:

*   Kathryn Schulz’s “The Really Big One,” which appeared in the _New Yorker_ July 20, 2015. Schulz, a New Yorker staff writer, won a Pulitzer Prize (one of the highest awards in journalism) for this article, which details the risk of a catastrophic earthquake and tsunami in the Pacific Northwest.

For class discussion: I’d like to focus on Schulz’s strategies in putting this long piece together, the level and amount of detail she includes, and on examples of good writing: so think about these things before coming to class. We’ll also reserve a little time to talk about our responses to the ideas in the article.

Class #12: Complex Issues: Keeping Readers with You; Getting at the Bigger Picture; The Research Process: Why We Cite
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #12: Write Proposal for Investigative Essay

Write a short 1 paragraph proposal for your {{% resource_link 6d7b6f32-13e4-c8cf-c485-796d172e9b0e "investigative essay" %}}.

### Readings:

*   “[Fusion: Joining the Quest for renewable Energy’s Holy Grail](http://cmsw.mit.edu/angles/2016/wp/fusion-joining-the-quest-for-the-renewable-energys-holy-grail/)” by Milo Knowles, from the 2016 _Angles_.
*   “[Fukushima and the Bogey-man](https://mitangles.wordpress.com/sugrue/)” by Rosie Sugrue.  (Note: Rosie is an especially accomplished writer.) 
*   “[Anorexia: A Matter of Life and Breadth](http://cmsw.mit.edu/angles/2014/?page_id=707)” by Minyi Lee.
*   “[Our Guts, Our Bodies, Ourselves](http://cmsw.mit.edu/angles/2014/?page_id=723)” by Dalia Walzer.

### Readings:

*   Hancock, Chapters 4 and 7. 

Chapter 4 provides some ways to think about structure. Chapter 7 has a lot of good ideas for when you’re feeling stuck. We will discuss these in class. If you haven’t read earlier chapters in Hancock, now would be a good time to skim them.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Assignment #16: Revise {{% resource_link 604d023b-fd0c-30ae-5353-3ae40038d3af "Profile Article" %}}

Readings:

*   “My Great-Great-Aunt Discovered Francium. And It Killed Her,” by Veronique Greenwood. This essay appeared in the _New York Times Magazine_ in 2014. Greenwood is a science writer whose work has appeared in _The Atlantic_ and _Discover_. 

For class discussion: Besides being a compelling story, the essay is a good example of how to handle scientific detail, so we’ll spend some time discussing that. What kinds of sources do you think Greenwood used to put this story together?

{{% resource_link 0db94956-df48-17cd-16d9-d6fe5d0e6e78 "Critique and respond" %}} to your workshop group members’ drafts of their investigative essays.

### Readings:

The readings for our next class are a selection of book reviews from the _NY Times Book Review_. The book review-essay is a hybrid genre (as the hyphen indicates)—in which the reviewer uses the opportunity of the review to develop an idea. That is, the book under consideration becomes the focal point for a discussion of an idea related to the book’s themes. Most of the essay describes the book, but the reviewer does so in a way that makes the book part of a wider conversation about some issue.

Note: Some of the reviews are more review than essay, and some are more essay than review. All should give you ideas about possible ways to think about your book talk. The reviews we’ll be reading and discussing are:

*   “Nor Any Drop to Drink? Why the Great Lakes Face a Murky Future,” Robert Moor’s review of Dan Egan’s book _The Death and Life of the Great Lakes_.
*   “Dreaming in Code” by Adam Frank, a review of Michio Kaku’s _The Future of the Mind_.
*   _The Invention of Nature_ by Andrea Wulf, reviewed by Colin Thubron.
*   “Science’s Invisible Women,” Dava Sobel’s review of _A Lab of One’s Own_ by Patricia Fara, and _Broad Band_ by Claire L Evans.

For class discussion: What do you notice about these reviews? How do the reviewers express judgments? How do they describe the books? How do they add something of their own perspective to the reviews? What kinds of themes do they emphasize? We’ll also take some time to discuss the ideas the reviews raise, according to what interests you as readers.

Class #26: Final Class
----------------------

For our final class meeting, we will celebrate the craft of science writing. Please bring to class:

*   1–2 pages of your own writing that you are especially pleased with.
*   If you’d like to, you may also bring a paragraph or two from any of our readings, or the book you read for your book talk, that you think is excellent, and be prepared to say why it’s good. We will share these.
