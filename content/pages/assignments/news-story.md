1.  Anderson, Kevin and Glen Peters. “[The Trouble with Negative Emissions](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6309/182).” _Science_ 354, no. 6309 (2016): 182–193.
2.  Yuen, C.M., C.A. Rodrigues, et al. “[Map the Gap](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4525371/).” _Public Health Action_ 5, no. 1 (2015): 45–58.

Timeline
--------

*   _Class #8_: Preliminary Sketch Due
*   _Class #9_: Essay Due, Workshop

Preliminary Sketch
------------------

Write a rough sketch of a news story for one of these articles—your choice. Include:

*   Why this story—why does it seem important? Why do you think readers will or should care about it?
*   What seems to be the essence of the story—the most important thing?
*   List the authors, their affiliation, and when and where the article was published. We’ll work with these in class.

Instructions
------------

Write a news story for a general audience based on 1 of the 2 designated readings.

*   The story should be clear and accurate.
*   Its significance should be clear and convincing.
*   The story should contain the key elements we discussed in class last week.
*   As a news story, it should not contain personal opinion.

### The Challenge:

In condensing the original material, you will have to be selective. It will help to first determine how you want to describe its significance, and for whom. What’s new or unusual will also be important.

### Research:

You should be able to glean what you need to know from the article itself. If there are unfamiliar terms, by all means look them up. If you want to know a little more about the context for the article, you can do a little research, but I suggest focusing your effort on reading carefully and understanding the terms.

### Citing:

As with The Science of Everyday Life, use superscripts for sources and include a list of sources at the end. After the bottom line of your name/date/word count, put in parentheses and italics the name of the publication for which you are imagining writing your story, like this: (_Boston Globe_).

Requirements
------------

*   1½ pp. (500–600 words)
